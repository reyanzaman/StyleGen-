# StyleGen-
Style Generator using Generative AI and then Fast Style Transfer using Tensorflow Style Hub Library

Due to hardware constraint, the data has been trained and tested on 64x64 rgb images
The dataset (Pattern.zip) contains 10 class and 300 images

This was just done as a demo and there are lots of improvements and adjustments that are yet to be done. 

## Screenshots

These are a few generated 64x64 resolution styles
